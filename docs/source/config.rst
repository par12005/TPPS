Configuration
=============

There are some elements of TPPS that can be configured to fit your specific needs! After installing TPPS, log into your site as an administrator. Then, from your dashboard, go to Modules --> TPPS --> Configure, or go to <base url>/admin/config/content/tpps. There are a few settings you can customize as an administrator:

* TPPS Admin Email Address: the email address used to send administrative tpps messages, such as notifications about submission status.
* File upload locations:

   * Author files: the location to store secondary author files
   * Tree Accession files: the location to store tree accession files
   * Genotype files: the location to store .VCF, .FASTA, and genotype assay files
   * Phenotype files: the location to store phenotype data and metadata files
