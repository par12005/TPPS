Coding Style Specifications
===========================

TPPS usually tries to adhere to the `Drupal coding style standards`. We will cover some of the most important coding style standards here:

 - Tabs are 2 spaces, indent using spaces not tabs.
 - Lines should never end in white space.
 - Starting curly braces should be on the same line as the if/for/while/etc statement, preceded by a space.
 - Ending curly braces should have their own line.
 - Each .php and .inc file should have a comment block describing the file. See any TPPS .php or .inc file for an example.
 - Each function in a .php or .inc file should have a comment block describing the function, as well as all of the parameters, return values, and global variables that the function uses.
 - Use Tripal API functions instead of Drupal API functions.
 - Variable names should use snake_case.
 - Function names in php should use snake_case, in JavaScript should use camelCase.
